There are already some important bug fixes and new features such as:
  * A Widget is now able to detect that the mouse enters it when a Widget above 
    it gets hidden and the mouse cursor was over it.
  * Text objects do not try to access rows if they are empty, which caused 
    crashes before.
  * Widgets now distribute events if their ancestors where shown/hidden.
  * UTF8 support for TextBox and TextField widgets.
  * Work is done in a separate branch to support auto-layouting in fifechan. 
    Needs to be improved and tested.
  * New widgets
    * Circular container, which implements a container that arranges its children
      in a circular fashion. (only available in the auto-layouting branch)
    * IconProgressBar, which implements a progressbar that uses images to show 
      progress.
    * PasswordField, which implements password input.
